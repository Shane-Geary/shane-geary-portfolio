						As a versatile{' '}
						<span className={styles['jobTitle']}>Software Engineer</span> with a
						robust background in both front-end development and cloud
						infrastructure, I excel in dynamic environments that require a blend

						(Amazon Web Services), and many more technologies, I bring a
						well-rounded understanding of full-stack development and cloud
						engineering.

						My journey began with a coding bootcamp and deepened through
						hands-on experience at a startup, where I discovered a passion for
						Information Technology—particularly AWS technologies, system
						administration, and network engineering. I initially pursued my
						degree at Grand Canyon University, maintaining a 4.0 GPA, before
						successfully transferring into the competitive{' '}
						<span className={styles['jobTitle']}>Informatics </span>program at
						the University at Albany. I'm now continuing my studies there,
						working toward a B.S. in Informatics with a focus on systems design
						and IT infrastructure.

					When I am not coding, I enjoy my love for music, both listening and
					playing. Growing up in a musical family, I learned several instruments
					by the time I was 18. I also found a love for electonic music
					production and sound design. Which crosses over nicely into my love
					for tech. An interesting fact about me, during my younger years, I
					found an interest and affinity for a sub-culture art called "Gloving".
					A dance style that uses LED gloves to create visual effects to music.
					I have performed at many music events and festivals in Colorado, both
					as a solo performer and as part of street teams. */}
